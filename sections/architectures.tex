\begin{frame}{What is a web application?}
  \begin{description}
    \item[Web applications] are web pages that are interactive, thanks to JavaScript.
    \item[JavaScript] is used to capture user events, and typically responds to them by firing off HTTP Requests in the background and changing the displayed resource based on the HTTP Response.
    \item[Resources] are typically generated on the fly by a web server, which usually interacts with a database.
    \item[LAMP] is an older architecture stack that follows this pattern.
    \item[MEAN] is a more modern stack.
